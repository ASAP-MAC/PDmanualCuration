# PDmanualCuration

This repository keeps track of the process of manually curating Parkinson's metadata.
Original metadata files are stored in `original_metadata/`, and each dataset is curated in its respectively named R script.
`harmonization.R` loads all of the original metadata for visualization.
Harmonized metadata will be output to `curated_metadata/`.
